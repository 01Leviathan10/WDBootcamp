        <p>Anton Anatolyevich Kushniruk (Russian: Антон Анатольевич Кушнирук; born 30 June 1995) is a Russian football defender.
            He plays for FC Sibir Novosibirsk. He made his debut in the Russian Second Division for FC Sibir-2 Novosibirsk
            on 5 June 2013 in a game against FC Sibiryak Bratsk. The BRDC C2 Championship (sometimes referred to as the British
            C2 Championship) was a short lived sports car racing series which ran from 1988 to 1990.

        </p>
        <p>Meant as a replacement for the dwindling Thundersports series, the C2 Championship would serve to bring international
            sports car racing seen in the World Sportscar Championship to Britain. By using the smaller C2 class only, the
            series was able to encourage more teams to enter not only due to the relatively low cost of the available cars,
            but also due to the lack of major automobile manufacturers to drive away competitors due to their dominance.

        </p>
        <p>Although only seven cars would attend the opening race at Silverstone Circuit, the series was able to expand to sixteen
            competitors by the end of its first year. Tiga chassis dominated the season as Team Istel drivers Tim Harvey
            and Chris Hodgetts took the first drivers' championship. For 1989, the series unfortunately suffered from entries
            as a maximum of only twelve cars were seen in some races.
